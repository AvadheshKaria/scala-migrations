* Allow Scala Migrations to be used in a Java environment.  Two
  things need to be done:

  a) The Migrator constructors take a Option[String] schema name
     argument.  In Java, this could be a String argument that is null
     for the None case.

  b) The Migrator.migrator() method takes a MigratorOperation argument
     which are either case classes or case objects.  The case classes
     work fine in Java, the case objects are a little harder to use
     since the user would need to use the class names with $ in them.

  It may be best to create a new JavaMigrator class that delegates to
  a Migrator.  The JavaMigrator will have a simple Java interface and
  it will not see the Scala methods.

* Enable a dry-run pass so that the SQL can be printed or logged
  without actually running it.

* Replace all uses of System.out.println with a logging system.
