Version 1.0.0 - February 11th, 2010
  * Provide Scala 2.8.0.Beta1 support.  Code modifications that work
    under both Scala 2.7.x and 2.8.x were applied to the default
    (2.7.x) branch and merged to the scala-2.8 branch to minimize the
    differences between the branches.
  * Fix a bug in dropping indices in Oracle.
  * Index names are now quoted and potentially case converted in the
    same manner as column names.
  * Provide a addingForeignKeyConstraintCreatesIndex method in
    Migration and DatabaseAdaper that returns true if the database
    implicitly adds an index on the column that has a foreign key
    constraint added to it.  This can be used to dynamically add an
    index for those databases that don't implicitly add an index on
    foreign key columns.
  * Switch to using scaladoc instead of vscaladoc when compiling with
    Scala 2.7.x to be consistent with compilation with Scala 2.8.x.
  * Update the test suite to run against Derby 10.5.3 instead of
    10.5.1.1.
  * Switch code style to be more compliant with standard Scala code,
    specifically, remove the space before a : in type annotations.

Version 0.9.2 - November 2nd, 2009
  * Build with Scala 2.7.7.

Version 0.9.1 - September 2nd, 2009
  * Add the ability to add and drop columns in existing tables.  The
    new methods are addColumn() and removeColumn() in the Migration
    class.

Version 0.9.0 - August 1st, 2009
  * First public release.
