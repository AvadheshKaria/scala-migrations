Version 1.0.3 - September 21st, 2012
  * Make log4jdbc optional by checking for it at runtime and using it
    if it is available.  This is to workaround log4jdbc not present in
    any public Maven repositories, to make it easier for developers
    using build tools with automatic dependency resolution so they do
    not have to download log4jdbc themselves:

  * For Scala 2.8.0 and greater, switch from ant/ivy to sbt to build
    the project.  In addition to reducing the number of files checked
    into source control to build the project, it also supports easy
    publishing to Sonatype's open-source repository.

Version 1.0.2 - November 8th, 2011
  * Issue #22: use java.lang.ClassLoader#getResources() instead of
    #getResource() in case there are multiple resources with the same
    package name.  Now all resources providing the package name are
    searched.
  * Issue #23: fix a bug by URL decoding resource URLs so that
    resources in directories containing one or more space characters
    can be found.

Version 1.0.1 - February 14th, 2010
  * New method Migration#alterColumn() which allows column definitions
    to be altered.
  * Initial support for building with Maven.  It only builds jars for
    JDBC 4/JDK 1.6, not for JDBC 3/JDK 1.5.  Build with ant to build
    JDBC 3/JDK 1.5 jars.
  * Usernames for Migration#grant() and #revoke() are now converted
    into the database's canonical case, e.g. lowercase or uppercase,
    and then quoted.
  * Refactor the unit tests to allow for testing with databases other
    than Derby.
  * The table names in the unit tests have been renamed to all start
    with "scala_migrations_".  This makes it easier to unit test the
    project in an existing schema.  The only table that doesn't start
    with "scala_migrations_" is "schema_migrations".
  * Lots of internal refactoring and code cleanup.

Version 1.0.0 - February 11th, 2010
  * Provide Scala 2.8.0.Beta1 support.  Code modifications that work
    under both Scala 2.7.x and 2.8.x were applied to the default
    (2.7.x) branch and merged to the scala-2.8 branch to minimize the
    differences between the branches.
  * Fix a bug in dropping indices in Oracle.
  * Index names are now quoted and potentially case converted in the
    same manner as column names.
  * Provide a addingForeignKeyConstraintCreatesIndex method in
    Migration and DatabaseAdaper that returns true if the database
    implicitly adds an index on the column that has a foreign key
    constraint added to it.  This can be used to dynamically add an
    index for those databases that don't implicitly add an index on
    foreign key columns.
  * Switch to using scaladoc instead of vscaladoc when compiling with
    Scala 2.7.x to be consistent with compilation with Scala 2.8.x.
  * Update the test suite to run against Derby 10.5.3 instead of
    10.5.1.1.
  * Switch code style to be more compliant with standard Scala code,
    specifically, remove the space before a : in type annotations.

Version 0.9.2 - November 2nd, 2009
  * Build with Scala 2.7.7.

Version 0.9.1 - September 2nd, 2009
  * Add the ability to add and drop columns in existing tables.  The
    new methods are addColumn() and removeColumn() in the Migration
    class.

Version 0.9.0 - August 1st, 2009
  * First public release.
