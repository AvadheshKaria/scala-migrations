This file describes the datatypes supported by the Scala Migrations
package and why some things are implemented the way they are.

INTEGER
-------

Oracle does not have an INTEGER SQL type comparable to other
databases, such such as Derby, MySQL and PostgreSQL, which use a
4-byte integer to store the value and limiting the integers that can
be inserted from -2147483648 to 2147483647.

If a column is defined in Oracle using "INTEGER" it uses a NUMBER(38)
to store it:

A Migration defining an integer column on Oracle uses a NUMBER(10, 0).
This is large enough to store any 4-byte integers from -2147483648 to
2147483647 but not any integers with more digits.  A NUMBER(10, 0)
does allow a larger range of values than the other databases, from
-9999999999 to 9999999999, but this seems like an acceptable solution
without using a CHECK constraint on the column.

NUMERIC and DECIMAL
------------------

There is a minor difference in the definition of the NUMERIC and
DECIMAL types according to the SQL 1992 standard downloaded from

http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt

  """
  17) NUMERIC specifies the data type exact numeric, with the decimal
      precision and scale specified by the <precision> and <scale>.

  18) DECIMAL specifies the data type exact numeric, with the decimal
      scale specified by the <scale> and the implementation-defined
      decimal precision equal to or greater than the value of the
      specified <precision>.
  """

However, in practice, all databases I looked at implement them
identically.

  *) Derby

     "NUMERIC is a synonym for DECIMAL and behaves the same way. See
     DECIMAL data type."

     http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.4/ref/rrefsqlj12362.html
     http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.4/ref/rrefsqlj15260.html

  *) Mysql

     "NUMERIC implemented as DECIMAL."

     http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/numeric-types.html

  *) Oracle

     Only has the NUMBER type.

     http://download-west.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/sql_elements001.htm#sthref218

  *) PostgreSQL

     "The types decimal and numeric are equivalent. Both types are
     part of the SQL standard."

     The docs use NUMERIC more and list DECIMAL as an alias.
